# SYRCityLine API

[SYRCityLine](http://cityline.syrgov.net/) is a service from the City of Syracuse for submitting services requests and tracking complaints, permits and permit applications. While this service is helpful, there is no API for looking up the status of records (e.g., to check the status of a complaint or permit).

This project attempts to create an API for th SYRCityLine service.
